# Coverage Types: Summary

- **Statement Coverage**: Ensures every line of code is executed. It's simple but can miss logical errors.
- **Branch Coverage**: Tests all possible branches in decision points. More thorough but might not cover complex conditions.
- **Predicate Coverage**: Ensures every condition in logical expressions is tested for both true and false, providing the highest level of coverage but requires more test cases.
